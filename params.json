{"name":"Sheet","body":"# Sheet\r\n\r\nEasily create and access snippets of text from your terminal. `sheet` is\r\nyour own personal wiki.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n\r\ngem install sheet\r\n```\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n\r\nsheet           # with no arguments it will just list all your sheets\r\nsheet git       # opens git sheet\r\nsheet new git   # creates git sheet\r\nsheet edit git  # edit git sheet\r\n```\r\n\r\nUse `sheet new <term>` to create your first sheet. Useful for jotting\r\ndown commands that you use often but somehow never remember.\r\n\r\n### Opening urls\r\n\r\nFound a great cheat sheet *online* about jquery or your favorite\r\nlanguage? I've got you covered.\r\n\r\nWhen writing your snippet, you can use this special format to\r\nautomatically open a url when opening your sheet:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n\r\nurl: http://example/com\r\n```\r\n\r\nMake sure that's you don't have trailing lines and sheet will\r\nautomatically open that url for you\r\n\r\nPlease note that to open urls, sheet will use the `open` command on mac\r\nos x and `xdg-open` in linux. Patches welcome for other systems.\r\n\r\n### Behind the scenes\r\n\r\n`sheet` stores your sheets in text files in the\r\n`~/.sheets` directory. You can go there and modify the files manually if you desire,\r\nor you can source them into version control and share them across\r\nmultiple systems.\r\n\r\nFor writing files, `sheet` looks for the `$EDITOR` global variable, and\r\nwill raise an error if no editor was found.\r\n\r\n### Help your stuff is broken\r\n\r\nI tested this software in mac os x with Ruby 1.9. If you find any bug\r\nwith other platforms/interpreters please let me know and I'll push a\r\nfix.\r\n\r\n### Contributing to sheet\r\n\r\n* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet.\r\n* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it.\r\n* Fork the project.\r\n* Start a feature/bugfix branch.\r\n* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution.\r\n* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.\r\n* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.\r\n\r\n### Copyright\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2012 Oscar Del Ben.
